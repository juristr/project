## Agenda

- 5.x progress
- ES latest build
- Flow

## 5.x progress

- Do we like the `withUnique()` mixin?
  - Definitely useful for tests.
  - Useful for having internal web components where Preact components may not (Shadow DOM encapsulation).
- Would be good to have Flow in sooner rather than later.
  - If TypeScript definitions change if we merged it later, then it could possibly break (low risk).

## Flow

- Flow can be merged sooner rather than later if we can get `get-typed` published.

## ES latest build

- Remove `module` in package.json.
- Merge es latest build.
