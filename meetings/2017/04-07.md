## Agenda

- 5.x progress
- Renderer API
- TypeScript / Flow

### 5.x progress

Todo:

- TS Typings skatejs/skatejs#1102
- Docs
- ???

Actions

- Blocked by developit/preact#621
- Check into polyfill problems with Angular, should we update @skatejs/web-components
- Get docs consistent with API
- Memoize `renderCallback()` that is passed in to `rendererCallback()`
- Create base class for custom renderers
- Release a beta version

### Renderer API

Are we Satisfied with it? The only thing I'm not quite sure about is creating a bound function on every render to avoid the consumer having to know how to pass arguments to the `renderCallback()`. For example, this would be a custom renderer for HyperHTML:

```js
import hyper from 'hyperhtml';
import { define, props, withProps, withRender } from 'skatejs';

const withHyperHTML = (Base = HTMLElement) => class extends withRender(withProps(Base)) {
  rendererCallback (shadowRoot, renderCallback) {
    if (!this.hyper) {
      this.hyper = hyper.bind(shadowRoot);
    }
    renderCallback();
  }
};
```

And you'd define a component that uses it like:

```js
class HyperElement extends withHyperHTML() {
  static props = {
    name: props.string
  }
  renderCallback ({ name }) {
    this.hyper`Hello, ${name || 'World'}!`;
  }
}
```

Would probably be better to expose a common base class for writing renderers for less friction:

```js
const Renderer = withRender(withProps());

class HyperRenderer extends Renderer {
  rendererCallback (shadowRoot, renderCallback) {
    if (!this.hyper) {
      this.hyper = hyper.bind(shadowRoot);
    }
    renderCallback();
  }
}
```

### TypeScript / Flow

Look up:

- Try extending classes that don't have defined types
- `allowSyntheticDefault` (off by default)
