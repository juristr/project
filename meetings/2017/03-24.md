### 5.x

#### `define()` / `static is` / Webpack HMR / SSR

PR for the following here: https://github.com/skatejs/skatejs/pull/1108

Currently `define()` creates a unique ID if you don't define a `static is` prop on your element class. This is fine for HMR, but falls short when used in SSR.

For context, I almost have SSR working so long as you don't use real Shadow DOM. However, If you want anonymous element names, generating a unique ID won't work because your SSR'd content will generate a unique ID for the tag names that are serialised to the client, and the components defined on the client side - when initialising - will have a separate unique ID generate for them. This means the content generated on the server won't be initialised by the components defined on the client.

I think if we can get deterministic, unique local names working, then we will soon have a very good story for server-side rendering.

I also think the best way to generate the deterministic tag names is by using a default getter for `static is` and remove the functionality from `define()`. This would propbably be provided by a `withUnique()` mixin.

#### Lots of breaking changes. Are we okay with this?

- Constructors as tag names to JSX. You can use http://github.com/skatejs/val. Maybe Preact `h` should be wrapped by default. It would add more code to Skate's bundle.
  - [ ] contribute this to Preact
- No more `skip`. Just remove, Preact doesn't visit unknown nodes. Just use `ref`.
- Returning arrays helpful because flexbox. Nest is doing this heavily.
  - [ ] talk to Jason to see where this is at
- `prop` to `props`
- Removed `props()` in favour of the instance property. Maybe a depreacation is better?
- Removed `defined` attribute from being set on the element during `connectedCallback()`
- Removed `ready()` callback

#### Migration plan

- Document migration path
- JSCodeShift?
- Maybe have a version 4.x compat?
  - [ ] Explore upgrade options.
    - Add more deprecation warnings to 4.x
    - Base class? Not viable for non-class functions.
    - Multiple versions? Hard with NPM / Bower.

#### Anything left to do?

- TypeScript definition
- Docs, docs, docs!
  - More examples
  - Use cases
  - Recipes

#### Proposed features

- `props` setter seems almost gratuitous but could prove useful
- Does Skate really not have the async props setting issue React has? For example: `setState(callback)`. In Skate, prop values are available immediately after setting, only renders are queued.

### Preact

I've been thinking about using Preact for a long time because it removes the need to wrap code around Incremental DOM for what we wanted to do, is fast and small. That said, it was still a spur of the moment change. Is everyone okay with this?

### Stuff not in core

- How should we organise it? Lerna repo? Separate repos?
- Like Shadow DOM shim: https://gist.github.com/treshugart/e19c2be255448cd31d261f2e8db2127c via a `withShadow()` mixin
- Contexts: https://gist.github.com/treshugart/fbc37ab7d19028b9fe22311bd1b634f4 via a `withContext()` mixin
- `childrenChangedCallback()` via a `withChildrenChanged()` mixin
- [ ] @hotell to create a repo for non-core stuff
